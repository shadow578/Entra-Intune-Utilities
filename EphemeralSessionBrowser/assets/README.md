assets for the ESP project (mainly program icon).
these assets are (manually) bundled into the main script, and are included here only for reference.


## Program Icon (EPS.psd / ESP.ico)

the program icon is a mashup of the chromium logo (hue-shifted to yellow) and a ghost icon licensed under the MIT license.

- Chromium logo taken from: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chromium_Material_Icon.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chromium_Material_Icon.svg). BSD license available under the same link. As stated above, a hue-shift was applied to the logo and a ghost icon was inserted.
- Ghost icon taken from: [https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/299658/ghost_icon](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/9025733/ghost_icon). MIT license available under the same link. The ghost icon was inserted into the chromium logo, and the color was changed to white.
